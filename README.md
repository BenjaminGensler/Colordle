### Inspiration
While deciding what my first interactive web-based project would be I decided I wanted to do something that was both simple in writing and had a lot of flexibility. In the end, I came upon the idea of reviving one of my favorite board games, ' Mastermind'.
During college, I introduced the game Mastermind to my friends and soon we were creating different codes for each other to crack and soon began adding our own rules to the game. Seeing that everyone enjoyed the game so much, especially with all of the extra rules we added, I had decided long ago that I would develop a game similar to this to it with our rules and a few others.
This game is to give others that same enjoyment we had and hopefully inspire others to develop their pet projects.
